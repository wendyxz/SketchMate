## Goal
Digital Whiteboard is a Kotlin desktop application that provides a virtual canvas for users to create, share, and collaborate on digital content in real-time. The application offers a range of features designed to facilitate creativity and productivity, including drawing tools, text input, shape insertion, and exporting features.

Users can create and edit drawings using the intuitive interface, which supports stylus selection for enhanced precision. The digital whiteboard also allows for easy sharing of content, enabling users to collaborate with others in real-time or share their creations with clients, colleagues, or friends.

The digital whiteboard provides various customization options for colors, line styles, and brush sizes, enabling users to personalize their drawings to suit their creative preferences.
